### Abstract
Data driven Knowledge Graph is rapidly adapted by different societies. Many open domain and specific domain knowledge graphs have been constructed, and many industries have benefited from knowledge graph. Currently, enterprise related knowledge graph is classified as specific domain, but the applications span from solving a narrow specific problem to Enterprise Knowledge Management system. With the digital transform of traditional industry, Enterprise knowledge becomes more and more complicated, it involves knowledge from common domain, multiple specific domains, and corporate-specific in general. This tutorial provides an overview of current Enterprise Knowledge Graph(EKG). It distinguishes the EKG from specific domain according to the knowledge it covers, and provides the examples to illustrate the difference between EKG and specific domain KG. The tutorial further summarizes EKG into three types: Specific Business Task Enterprise KG, Specific Business Unit Enterprise KG and Cross Business Unit Enterprise KG, and illustrates the characteristics, steps, challenges, and future research in constructing and consuming of each of these three types of EKG.

### Outline
– **Part 1.** Enterprise Knowledge and Enterprise Knowledge Graph (**60** minutes)

There are three types of EKG: Specific Business Task EKG, Specific Business Unit EKG and Cross Business Unit EKG.
This section discusses the characteristics of these three types of EKG, and challenges to construct different types of EKG through examples.

**Breaks 15 minutes**

– **Part 2.** Construction of Enterprise Knowledge Graph (**60** minutes)

The section provides review of EKG construction techniques, which includes entity recognition, relation extraction, and KG refinement.

– **Part 3.** Challenges and future research in Enterprise Knowledge Graph (**45** minutes).

The last section will discuss the challenges and Potential future research directions in EKG field.
